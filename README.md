# r-devcontainer

Documenting my Docker containers here for R development.

## Usage

Pull container from Docker Hub

``` bash
# Pull image
docker pull knitz/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09
```

Starting containers from image

- `--name` = name of created container
- `-v` = bind mounting `host_dir:container_dir`
- `-w` = initial working directory in container
- `-p` = port mapping `host:container`
- `-d` = detached container running in background
  - Can attach a terminal with `docker exec <container-id> zsh`
- `-it` = Attach an interactive terminal
- `--rm` = Automatically stop & delete container when all terminals / processes done

``` bash
# Run disposable container in background with rserver running
# `docker stop <container-id>` when done to stop & remove container
docker run -d --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/$(basename $(pwd))" \
  -w /workspaces/$(basename $(pwd)) \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  knitz/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09 \
  start-rstudio

# Run disposable container and open up a terminal
# Run `start-rstudio` to start rserver
# Kill terminal to stop and delete container
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/$(basename $(pwd))" \
  -w /workspaces/$(basename $(pwd)) \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  knitz/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09

# Run named, persistent container in background with rserver running
# `docker stop <container-id>` when done to stop
# `docker start <container-id>` to start it again
# `docker rm <container-id>` to delete container
docker run -d \
  --name "my-container" \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/$(basename $(pwd))" \
  -w /workspaces/$(basename $(pwd)) \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  knitz/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09 start-rstudio

# Run named, persistent container and open up a terminal
# Run `start-rstudio` to start rserver
# Container will stop when all terminals are exited or use `docker stop`
# `docker start <container-id>` to start it again
# `docker rm <container-id>` to delete container
docker run -it \
  --name "my-container" \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspaces/$(basename $(pwd))" \
  -w /workspaces/$(basename $(pwd)) \
  -p 8787:8787 \
  knitz/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09

## Build Documentation

This container is based on `rocker/r-ver`: <https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/r-ver.html> with Ubuntu 22.04 with R already built from source for `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64` architecture.

### devcontainer features

I've made use of "devcontainer" features: <https://containers.dev/>. However, these are generally made to be installed over an image during container build. Instead, `build-scripts/pull-build-scripts.sh` is run before the `docker build` step to populate `build-scripts/` with code from several features, essentially baking these features into the image, rather than their intended use installing on the fly. The `Dockerfile` will then copy these scripts into the image during the build step and use them to build each feature.

Most of the devcontainer features will generally have a simple `install.sh` script, however, others might use special features in the Dev Container CLI (<https://github.com/devcontainers/cli>), for example scripts run at container creation time (onCreate) or after a feature has attached (postAttachCommand). Any functionality with these special parameters is instead adapted manually into the image itself or as parameters to a `docker run` command, etc. E.g., see `oncreate.sh` [here](https://github.com/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/blob/main/src/rstudio-server/oncreate.sh).

With an image that already has useful features built in, there's no need to wait for the devcontainer CLI to install features, at the expense of some upfront configuration and image building. It's also useful for adapting docker images as Apptainer / Singularity images but retaining the functionality of the devcontainer features.

### Pull build scripts from repositories

Currently pulling these features into the image:

- [features/src/common-utils at main · devcontainers/features · GitHub](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/common-utils)
- [features/src/git at main · devcontainers/features · GitHub](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/git)
- [devcontainer-features/src/pandoc at main · rocker-org/devcontainer-features · GitHub](https://github.com/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/pandoc)
- [devcontainer-features/src/quarto-cli at main · rocker-org/devcontainer-features · GitHub](https://github.com/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/quarto-cli)
- [devcontainer-features/src/rstudio-server at main · rocker-org/devcontainer-features · GitHub](https://github.com/rocker-org/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/rstudio-server)
- [devcontainer-features/src/neovim at main · duduribeiro/devcontainer-features · GitHub](https://github.com/duduribeiro/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/neovim)
- [devcontainer-features/src/tmux at main · duduribeiro/devcontainer-features · GitHub](https://github.com/duduribeiro/devcontainer-features/tree/main/src/tmux)
- and just for fun: [features/src/neofetch at main · devcontainers-contrib/features · GitHub](https://github.com/devcontainers-contrib/features/tree/main/src/neofetch)

This script pulls from the respective GitHub repositories, and the features are tied to specific commits so that they are robust to any feature updates.

``` bash
# Populate build-scripts/ directory with subdirectories for each feature
bash build-scripts/pull-build-scripts.sh
```

### Build Docker image from Dockerfile

For tags, I'm adding this info:

- R version: e.g., r441 for R 4.4.1. These are limited to what I'm able to pull from `rocker/r-ver`.
- Platform: Until I figure out making any images cross-platform, I'm adding either amd64 or arm64 corresponding to the architecture (only these two are available in `rocker/r-ver`).
- Dates: corresponding to availability from Posit Package Manger for CRAN and Bioconductor packages. These lock in package versions to those that were available on a certain date. Currently I have R packages `httpgd` ([GitHub - nx10/httpgd: Asynchronous http server graphics device for R.](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd)) and `presto` ([GitHub - immunogenomics/presto: Fast Wilcoxon and auROC](https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto)) as just installing the latest version, not from a specific date.

``` bash
# Build
docker build -t r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09 .
docker tag r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09 <docker-hub-username>/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09
docker push <docker-hub-username>/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09
```

### Push to Docker Hub

Tag the image prepended with Docker Hub username, then push

``` bash
docker tag r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09 <docker-hub-username>/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09
docker push <docker-hub-username>/r-devcontainer:r441-amd64-2024-09-09
```
